					What is python?
				</header>
				<p>
					Python is a popular programming language. 
					It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
				</p>
				<p>
					Python is a great general-purpose programming language that’s becoming increasingly popular for data science.
					 Demand for these skills is rising because companies want to harvest insights from their data.
					  This introduction to Python course is one of the most popular courses on DataCamp.
					<br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>
				</p>
				<code>
					x=5
					y="naveen"
					print(x)
					print(y)
				</code>
				<br>
				<p> python was designed for readability,and 
					<br>python uses new lines to complete a command.

				<header>
					Data analysis and
					 machine learning
				</header>
				<p>
					Python has become a staple in data science,
					 allowing data analysts and other professionals
					  to use the language to conduct complex statistical calculations,
					   create data visualizations, build machine learning algorithms,
					    manipulate and analyze data,
						 and complete other data-related tasks.
				</p>
				<p><b>data : </b>An data is an identifiable
					entity with some characteristics and behavior.
					An Object is an instance of a Class. When a
					class is defined, no memory is allocated but
					when it is instantiated (i.e. an
					object is created) memory is allocated.
					<br>
					<b>Class : </b>The building block of python that
					leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
					It is a user-defined data type, which holds its
					own data members and member functions, which can
					be accessed & used by creating an instance
					of that class. A class is like a blueprint for
					an object. For Example: Consider the Class
					of Cars. Python can build a wide range of different data visualizations,
				    like line and bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, and 3D plots.
				    Python also has a number of libraries that enable coders to write programs 
					for data analysis and machine learning more quickly and efficiently, like TensorFlow and Keras.

				<header>
					Automation or scripting
				</header>
				<p>
					If you find yourself performing a task repeatedly,
					 you could work more efficiently by automating it with Python.
					Writing code used to build these automated processes is called scripting. 
					In the coding world, automation can be used to check for errors across multiple files, convert files,
				    execute simple math, and remove duplicates in data.
				</p>
				<p>
					Python can even be used by relative beginners to automate.
					 simple tasks on the computer—such as renaming files.
					  finding and downloading online content or sending emails or texts at desired intervals.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="main-section" id="Polymorphism">
				<header>
					Polymorphism
				</header>
				<p>
					The word polymorphism means having many
					forms. In simple words, we can define
					polymorphism as the ability of a message
					to be displayed in more than one form.
					A real-life example of polymorphism, a
					person at the same time can have
					different characteristics.
					Like a man at the same time is a father,
					a husband, an employee. So the same
					person posses different behavior in
					different situations. This is called
					polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
					as one of the important features of Object
					Oriented Programming.
					<br>
					<b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly
						divided into two types:</b>
					<br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
					2. Runtime Polymorphism
				</p>

				<p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of
					polymorphism is achieved by function
					overloading or operator overloading.
					<br> Runtime polymorphism: This type
					of polymorphism is achieved by
					Function Overriding.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="main-section" id="Abstraction">
				<header>
					Abstraction
				</header>

				<p>
					Data abstraction is one of the most
					essential and important feature of object
					oriented programming in C++. Abstraction
					means displaying only essential information
					and hiding the details. Data abstraction
					refers to providing only essential information
					about the data to the outside world,
					hiding the background details or implementation.
					<br> Consider a real life example of a man driving
					a car. The man only knows that pressing the
					accelerators will increase the speed of car
					or applying brakes will stop the car but he
					does not know about how on pressing accelerator
					the speed is actually increasing, he does
					not know about the inner mechanism of the car
					or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
					etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can
					implement Abstraction in C++ using classes.
					Class helps us to group data members and member
					functions using available access specifiers. A
					Class can decide which data member will be
					visible to outside
					world and which is not.
					<br>
					<b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One
					more type of abstraction in C++ can be
					header files. For example, consider the
					pow() method present in math.h header file.
					Whenever we need to calculate power of a
					number, we simply call the
					function pow() present in the math.h header
					file and pass the numbers as arguments
					without knowing the underlying algorithm
					according to which the function is actually
					calculating power of numbers.
					<br><br><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:

					</b><br> 1. Helps the user to avoid writing
					the low level code.<br> 2. Avoids code
					duplication and increases reusability.<br>
					3. Can change internal implementation of
					class independently without
					affecting the user.<br> 4. Helps to
					increase security of an application or program
					as only important details are
					provided to the user.

				<header>
					Encapsulation
				</header>
				<p>
					In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
					as wrapping up of data and information
					under a single unit. In Object Oriented
					Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
					binding together the data and the functions
					that manipulates them. Consider
					a real life example
					of encapsulation, in a company there are
					different sections like the accounts section,
					finance section, sales section etc. The finance
					section handles all the financial transactions
					and keep records of all the data related to
					finance.
					Similarly the sales section handles all the
					sales related activities and keep records of
					all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
					when for some reason an official from finance
					section needs all the data about sales in a
					particular
					month. In this case, he is not allowed to
					directly access the data of sales section.
					He will first have to contact some other
					officer in the sales section and then
					request him to
					give the particular data. This is what
					encapsulation is. Here the data of
					sales section and the
					employees that can manipulate them are
					wrapped under a single name “sales section”.
				</p>

				<p>
					Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
					or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
					the data. In the above example the data of
					any of the section like sales, finance or
					accounts is hidden from any other section.<br>
					In C++ encapsulation
					can be implemented using Class
					and access modifiers.
